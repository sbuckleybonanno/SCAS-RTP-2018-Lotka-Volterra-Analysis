# SCAS-RTP-2018-Lotka-Volterra-Analysis

This contains the scripts used in producing the results for the paper **Applying the Lotkaâ€“Volterra model to the dynamics of chemical species within complex reaction networks** by Samuel Buckley-Bonanno, as part of the Southern California Academy of Sciences Research Training Program for 2018. 

The script in LV Competitive models the (Competitive Lotka-Volterra model)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations]. The numer of species is variable, though these constants are contained within the file rather than as command arguments.
