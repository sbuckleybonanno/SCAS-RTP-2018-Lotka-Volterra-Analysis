# SCAS-RTP-2018-Lotka-Volterra-Analysis

This contains the scripts used in producing the results for the paper **Applying the Lotkaâ€“Volterra model to the dynamics of chemical species within complex reaction networks** by Samuel Buckley-Bonanno, as part of the Southern California Academy of Sciences Research Training Program for 2018. 

The script in the folder "LV Competitive" models the [Competitive Lotka-Volterra model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations). The numer of species is variable, though these constants are contained within the file rather than as command arguments.

In "LV," there are scripts to model the base ("vanilla") Lotka-Volterra model, and the variant of the model that was derived in the paper. For each of these, there is a separate script to plot the phase space of system, with a set of initial conditions along the set defined by y = x.
